<h1> <em>The Avengers </em></h1> <br>
<br>
<h2 id="Thor paragraph"> Thor </h2>
<p> <strong>Thor, also known as Thor Odinson is the God of thunder and the son of the mighty Odin. He is more than a thousand years old and he is a part of the Avengers, <br>
the Earths mightiest heroes. His mom's name is Frigga and his brother's name is Loki. Thor's main weapon is his might hammer-<strong> <em> the Mjolnir.</em> </strong><br>
However, even without his hammer, he is the strongest avenger by far according to me. In Avengers:Infinity War he gets a new axe called Stormbreaker. Apart from being <br>
powerful, Thor is also very humorous. Thor is my favourite avenger.<strong></p><br>

<h2> Captain America </h2>
<p> <strong>Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America is one of the Avengers. But did you know? Before he got his powers, he was just a small boy in Brooklyn.<br>
He was in the frozen ice for almost 70 years and woke up in 2011. His main weapon is his shield which has the American symbol onit. His shield is made of vibraneum-<br>
the strongest metal on Earth made in Wakanda. He is very loyal to his friend Bucky.<strong></p> <br>

<h2> Iron Man </h2>
<p><strong> Anthony Edward Stark is a fictional character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise—based on the Marvel Comics<br>
 character of the same name—commonly known by his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO <br>
 of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his<br>
 technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.<strong><br></p>

<h2> Hulk </h2>
<p> <strong>Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when <br>
subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength <br>
is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's<br>
fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude,<br>
the character has a large supporting cast.<strong></p><br>

<h2> Black Widow </h2>
<p><strong> Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanova, also known as Black Widow  was introduced as a Russian spy, an antagonist of the superhero Iron Man.<br>
She later defected to the United States, becoming an agent of the fictional spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and a member of the superhero team the Avengers.<br>
Romanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist Boris Turgenov in the assassination of Professor Anton Vanko for defecting<br>
from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated Stark Industries as part of the plan.<br>
She attempted to manipulate information from American defense contractor Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, Iron Man.<br>
The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov stole and wore the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov <br>
in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol. Romanova later meets the criminal archer Hawkeye and sets him against Iron Man,<br>
and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<strong><br></p>

<h2> Hawkeye </h2>
<p> <strong> Clint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called "Hawkeye", otherwise known as<br>
 "The World's Greatest Marksman". He spent some time as a member of Tiboldt's Circus,[14] before joining the Coney Island Circus.<br>
 He witnessed Iron Man in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first <br>
 outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met Black Widow, a spy for the Soviet Union, <br>
 with whom he fell in love. Mindlessly following Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark (Iron Man).<br>
 In one of their battles with Iron Man, Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life.<br>
 But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a "straight-shooter" from then on.<br> </strong> </p>
